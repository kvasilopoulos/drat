# drat

This drat for both insertion of packages, and usage from R.

## Current Content

Please see here for packages currently in the ghrr repo. Setup Simply
install the drat CRAN package the usual way via install.packages(“drat”,
repos=“<http://cran.rstudio.com>”). Add one line to your .Rprofile file
(or to Rprofile.site): drat:::add(“ghrr”) That’s it\! Now use
install.packages() or update.packages() and the ghrr will be considered
just like the standard repositories for R.
