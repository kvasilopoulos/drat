![Build
packages](https://github.com/kvasilopoulos/drat/workflows/Build%20packages/badge.svg)

There are two ways to install packages from this [drat
repo](https://github.com/kvasilopoulos/drat).

1.  By specifying the repo in `install.packages()`

<!-- end list -->

``` r
install.packages('exuberdata', repos = 'https://kvasilopoulos.github.io/drat/', type = 'source')
```

2.  By registering `kvasilopoulos` repository as a valid repository

<!-- end list -->

``` r
install.packages("drat")
drat:::add("kvasilopoulos")
```

Now you can install and update packages without specfying the `repo` and
the `type`.

``` r
install.packages("exuberdata")
```

# Maintaining this page

## drat.builder and gh-actions

Instructions on the how to set up drat.builder with gh-actions are in
this [Post](https://zkamvar.netlify.app/) by [Zhian N.
Kamvar](https://github.com/zkamvar).

The packages included in this drat repository are maintained in the
[packages.txt](./packages.txt), which contains the github accounts and
names of the packages.

The data and metadata associated with this page are built with the

you want to update a package (e.g. change its version number), edit the
[packages.txt](./packages.txt) file and the [GitHub
Action](https://github.com/kvasilopoulos/drat/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build+packages%22)
will update the packages automagically.
