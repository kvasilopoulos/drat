# drat


This  drat for both insertion of packages, and usage from R.

## Current Content
Please see here for packages currently in the ghrr repo. Setup Simply install the drat CRAN package the usual way via install.packages("drat", repos="http://cran.rstudio.com").
Add one line to your .Rprofile file (or to Rprofile.site):
drat:::add("ghrr")
That's it! Now use install.packages() or update.packages() and the ghrr will be considered just like the standard repositories for R.
